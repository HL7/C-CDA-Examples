## Comments

* This example shows how an ordered referral could have a completed encounter. The link to the enocunter is through the sdtc extension sdtc:inFulfillmentOf1.

* The examples task force has approved multiple examples in regards to a closed loop referral. The Planned Referral Act opens the loop and the encounter  would be eligible to close the loop. This examples combines into one for ease of reader. In a 'real-world' exchange these would be likely be in separate documents.
