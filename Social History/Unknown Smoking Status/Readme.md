###Comments

* This is an example of unknown smoking status. There is a major variation in how no information is managed for smoking status. C-CDA explicitly guides to not utilize a nullFlavor for this information. Instead a SNOMED code should be used as demonstrated in the example. A best practice to avoid confusion is for each social history section to only include a single smoking status.
