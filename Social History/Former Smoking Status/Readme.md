###Comments

* This is an example of a former smoker in smoking status. There is a variation in how effectiveTime/high is used since this represents when the patient stopped smoking, not when they stopped being a former smoker. C-CDA explicitly guides to this usage of effectiveTime. A best practice to avoid confusion is for each social history section to only include a single smoking status.
