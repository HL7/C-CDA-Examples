Care Team
•	Dr Albert Davis, 2472 Rocky place, Beaverton, OR 97006
•	Tracy Davis, 555-555-1002, 2472 Rocky place, Beaverton, OR 97006

This example includes members of the Care Team in the documentationOf/serviceEvent.

From C-CDA R2.1 we have this statement:
	A serviceEvent represents the main act being documented, such as a colonoscopy or a cardiac stress study. In a provision of healthcare serviceEvent, the care providers, PCP, or other longitudinal providers, are recorded within the serviceEvent.
	
and for serviceEvent/performer the guide says:
	The performer participant represents clinicians who actually and principally carry out the serviceEvent. In a transfer of care this represents the healthcare providers involved in the current or pertinent historical care of the patient. Preferably, the patient’s key healthcare care team members would be listed, particularly their primary physician and any active consulting physicians, therapists, and counselors
	
For single encounter events, the guide says:
	If the document is about a single encounter, the providers associated can be recorded in the componentOf/encompassingEncounter template. The componentOf/encompassingEncounter may be used to document any subset of the providers on the care team that were active participants in the encounter.
