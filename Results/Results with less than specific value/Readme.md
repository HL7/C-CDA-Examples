###Comments

* This is an example of how to encode "less than or equal to" a specific range when returned from lab equipment. The example is for BNP, an immunoassay where the lower threshold for detection is often 5 pg/mL. The lower bound of the interval is zero in this example, even though this is none may be specified, since zero is the lower bound for measures of physical quantity. This example also includes a structured reference range.
