###Comments

* This is an example of how to encode positive and negative, which are common data types returned form lab equipment. While some technologies may represent this as a type of ST (string), it is logical and easily possible to encode this information using SNOMED-CT. This would allow structured examination of this information downstream as well as comparison to a structured reference range, as shown in the example.
