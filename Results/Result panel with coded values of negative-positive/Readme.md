###Comments

* This is an example of how to encode positive and negative, which are common data types returned form lab equipment. While some technologies may represent this as a type of ST (string), it is logical and easily possible to encode this information using SNOMED-CT. This would allow structured examination of this information downstream as well as comparison to a structured reference range, as shown in the example.
* Previously the examples task force approved this sample with the data type Coded Ordinal (CO) with the example name: Result panel with two ordinal values of negative-positive. The examples task force received feedback during implementation that CO is not commonly used, and CD is preferred. Updated the sample name to Result panel with coded values of negative-positive
