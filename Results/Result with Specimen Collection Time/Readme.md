### Comments

* This example shows where to record the specimen collection time. 
* In a Result Organizer entry, the organizer contains the set of observations for a single test, test panel, or testing activity. The effectiveTime within the organizer 
reflects the range of time covered by the collection of observations in the entry. The effectiveTime represents the time interval encompassed by the component observations.
* The organizer/author/time asserts the point in time when the test/panel/testing activity information was documented in the patient's chart.
* The effectiveTime of a component observation represents the biologically relevant time of that measurement. Therefore it tells when the specimen for that meausurement was collected.
