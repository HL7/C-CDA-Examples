###Comments

* This is an example of how to encode "greater than" (but not equal to) a specific range when returned from lab equipment. The example is for a point-of-care glucometer, which measures blood sugar for diabetics. Often these devices may have an upper bound, 500 mg/dL is shown in this example. An inclusive tag of false is shown to demonstrate a non-inclusive range. The upper bound of the interval is positive infinity in this example. This example also includes two structured reference ranges for normal and high.
