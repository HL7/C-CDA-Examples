       I have used the peripheral nerve stimulator in my back for five days. 
        While using it I found that I was able to do physical activity 
        without pain. However, afterwards for one day, I would feel pain but 
        then it would go away. I also noticed that I didnï¿½t have to take the 
        Vicodin as much. I took 2 less Vicodin per day and 2 less tramadol 
        everyday. I have not lain in my bed in a year and a half. I sleep in 
        a recliner.
