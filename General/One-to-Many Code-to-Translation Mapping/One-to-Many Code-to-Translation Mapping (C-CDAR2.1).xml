<!-- This example offers a non-normative way to handle coded concepts that require more than one code in a given codeSystem to be fully represented.
     Per CDA §2.6.8 Qualifier: "Use of qualifiers outside the boundaries specified by the code system is a non-conformant use of the CD data type," which
     this example is doing. However, given the need to solve this problem, this example was put forward as one potential solution in the absence of any better one.
     Implementers seeking to address this problem are encouraged to come forward with better alternatives if they exist.

     For example, the concept "Diabetes mellitus AND insipidus with optic atrophy AND deafness" exists in IMO's problem vocabulary, and can be represented
     by a single SNOMED code, but can't be fully represented by any one ICD-10 code. A sender could choose to translate this concept into ICD-10 codes
     as follows: -->
<value xsi:type="CD" code="70694009" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.6.96" codeSystemName="SNOMED CT" displayName="Diabetes mellitus AND insipidus with optic atrophy AND deafness">
    <!-- One translation per codeSystem, and receivers that don't understand the qualifier will still be able to look at each translation and at least get part of the picture. Receivers that do should interpret the qualifier SUMM as ANDing these problems together. -->
    <translation code="E11.39" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.6.90" codeSystemName="ICD10" displayName="Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other diabetic ophthalmic complication">

</value>

<!-- Now, let’s consider a different problem that can't be represented by one SNOMED, ICD-10, etc. code. Here, the qualifier is also included directly underneath the value--that is, we use the same semantics for the value itself as we do for its translations. For instance, the problem "Diabetes mellitus due to underlying condition with chronic kidney disease on chronic dialysis (CMS/HCC)" might look like this: -->
<value xsi:type="CD" code="8801005" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.6.96" codeSystemName="SNOMED CT" displayName="Secondary diabetes mellitus">
