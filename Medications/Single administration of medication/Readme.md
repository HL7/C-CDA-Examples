###Comments

* This is an example of two baby aspirin being administered at a single point in time. At the January 2014 San Antonio meeting of HL7, this approach was decided as appropriate for medication timing of a point in time. Subsequent to that meeting, the TTT validator was adjusted to accept this format for medication times.
