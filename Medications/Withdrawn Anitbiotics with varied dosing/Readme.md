###Comments

* some [background](http://wiki.hl7.org/images/e/ee/2014-05-22_Critique_of_HL7_CDA_structured_tapering_dose_Azithromycin_example_w_Figures.docx) on the dissent for encoding this medication
* This is an example of a medication with dosing that varies over time.
* This is an example of a common pattern for antibiotic administration which is complex (double dose on day 1, commonly known as Z-PAK).
* SDWG reviewed this example with the Pharmacy working group in February 2014. This dosing regimen may be characterized as a loading dose, but a similar approach could be used for a tapered dose as well. At the May 2014 Working Group the committee discussed whether this example would be better with just a free text sig which now exists as a new template in C-CDA R2.1
