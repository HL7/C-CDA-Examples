##Medication Section Examples from C-CDA 

For all Medication examples the example task force agreed (8/28/2014) to only include institutionSpecified on the effectiveTime when the value is true. InstitutionSpecified indicates whether the exact timing is up to the party executing the schedule (e.g., to distinguish "every 8 hours" (false) from "3 times a day" (true)).
