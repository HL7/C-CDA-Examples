                    <paragraph> Dear Reerring Doctor: Thank you for referring Ms. Everywoman for evaluation. As
                        you know, she is a 40-year-old woman who has had chronic gastrointestinal
                        symptoms. Approximately 18 years ago, she was hospitalized with a bleeding
                        ulcer. She had a CT scan of the abdomen, which revealed findings consistent with
                        focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). She has had epigastric abdominal pain as well
                        as a significant change in her bowel movements from baseline constipation to
                        frequent diarrhea. The past medical history is otherwise negative. She takes no
                        prescription medications. The remainder of the history is not contributory. </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Physical examination revealed a well-appearing woman. The vital signs
                        were normal. The head and neck were unremarkable. The lung fields were clear.
                        The heart exam was normal. The abdomen was obese with normal bowel sounds. There
                        was no tenderness, mass, or hepatosplenomegaly. </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Endoscopic evaluation revealed a normal colonoscopy. Biopsies taken
                        throughout the colon were essentially unremarkable. Stool tests for pathogenic
                        organisms were negative. Of note, on the upper endoscopy examination, no
                        significant abnormalities were seen; however, upon biopsy, features of celiac
                        disease were noted.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph> In summary, this 40-year-old woman has evidence of celiac disease. We
                        discussed the diagnosis in detail in the office. She was advised to undertake a
                        lifelong gluten-free diet. Followup laboratories in my office were notable for a
                        low serum iron with a low-normal ferritin. The bone density was normal. Repeat
                        triple-phase CT scan of the liver revealed no change in the right hepatic lobe
                        lesion, which is consistent with FNH. I advised periodic reevaluation of the
                        liver with imaging, as well as followup for any potential development of
                        nutritional deficiencies. She should take an iron supplement and continue on a
                        lifelong gluten-free diet. </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Thank you for the courtesy of this referral. I would be pleased to see
                        Ms. Everywoman in followup.</paragraph>
