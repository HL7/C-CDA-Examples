###Validation location
* HL7 Schematron (Diameter Health hosted) January 2019

###Comments: 
* This is an example of how one could report quality measures in a C-CDA document. It is not a C-CDA template, but could be included as a section (since open template) and is conformant to QRDA1 Measure Section constraints. It would not be appropriate for US QRDA submission.
